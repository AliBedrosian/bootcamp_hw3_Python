Alison McCondichie - Homework 3 - Python

The purpose of this homework was to show how to utilize Python code to analyze large volumes of data in a quick, repeatable way.

Importing the csv was tricky at first but I found that when I opened the parent folder of the project in Visual Studio Code it worked perfectly. 

The VBA homeowrk in week two was very helpful to find a starting point and general flow needed for looping through rows with an incrimenting total, and keeping track of a max and min. 

I found the syntax in Python much easier to understand and process. 

PyPoll had slightly more work to do only because it involved the use of dictionaries to keep track of the candidate and the votes. Once I understood the flow of calling on certain values in a dictionary with the .get method, this part was easier. 

I created a parent Submission folder with my written code and analysis, and a submission folder for each individual Python project for organization.
